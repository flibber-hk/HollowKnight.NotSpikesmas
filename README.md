# Not Spikesmas

Adds an item "Not Spikesmas" which causes the knight to take 0 damage from spikes (the knight will still hazard respawn).

Obtaining this item will put spike tunnels into logic, if they were not already.

It is recommended to disable "Shade Skips" while this is active, as some shade skips may become impossible when dying to spikes is impossible.
